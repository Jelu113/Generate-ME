 ## Description
 This project is run in node and not deployable. But here is the Github link https://github.com/Jelu113/Generate-ME.
 To create a README generator so I wouldn't forget any important information that belongs in a README file. 
 I built this project to learn node.js and Markdown.
 I no longer have to worry about forgetting a section in my README file, because I have a generator that will prompt me to fill in the necessary information. 
 I learned node.js and Markdown.
 It is simple and convienent to use.
 My computer decided to reject VS code during this project and I had to redo it several times and reload etc, VS code.
 I would like to add more Markdown functions. To polish the look more. 

## Installation
To install, simply clone the code, open it in VS code, have node.js installed and then execute by typing node index.js.
