 ## Description

 I created a README generator to ensure I did not forget any parts of the README file, now or in the future. 
 I also created it to better learn node.js and Markdown.
 I no longer have to worry about forgetting a section in my README file, because I have a generator that will prompt me to fill in the necessary information.
 I was successful in learing node.js and Markdown. 
 
 My computer decided to not work with VSCode for a while during this project, but I was able to figure out how to uninstall, reinstall and get it to work again. 
 While this is awesome, I don't think it is done yet, I would like to learn more Markdown functions to make it really shine.

## Installation
To install, simply clone the code, open it in VSCode, have node.js installed and then execute by typing node index.js in the terminal.
